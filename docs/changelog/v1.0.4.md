This mod has been reported to crash the game when using 1.21.2+ due to internal changes in Minecraft, as reported in
[#6](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/6).

This release updates mod metadata to mark the mod as incompatible with Minecraft 1.21.2 and later versions to prevent 
automated installations on unsupported versions.

This is a temporary measure while a proper fix is developed. Future releases will aim to restore compatibility with
Minecraft 1.21.2+.

**Full Changelog**: [compare v1.0.3 with v1.0.4](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/compare/v1.0.3...v1.0.4)
